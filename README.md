Snowflake Ski Resort

This project was for my server-side web development class Sophomore year. Snowflake Ski Resort is a ficticious organization, however this site can serve as demonstration for learning about web-technologies and strategies. The server side of this project is written in php in a MVC architecture. For the database interactions I used php DBOs with prepared statements to interact with a mySQL database. The client side consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript with jQuery.
